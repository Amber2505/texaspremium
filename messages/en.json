This coverage only pays for damages and injuries you cause to others in an at-fault accident. Liability insurance does not cover your own injuries or Motorcycle damage - you need additional coverage like collision or comprehensive for that protection.",
        "comprehensive": "Comprehensive covers damage to your Motorcycle from non-collision events like theft, weather, vandalism, or animal strikes. Collision covers damage to your Motorcycle from crashes with other Motorcycles or objects. Both are optional in Texas but typically required if you have a car loan or lease - together they provide 'full coverage' protecting your own Motorcycle regardless of fault.",
        "pip": "PIP covers your medical expenses, lost wages (up to 80%), and household services regardless of who caused the accident. Texas requires insurance companies to offer at least $2,500 of PIP coverage, though it's optional to purchase. PIP is not mandatory in Texas but provides immediate coverage for you and your passengers without waiting to determine fault in an accident.",
        "medpay": "MedPay covers medical bills for you and your passengers after an accident, regardless of who's at fault. It's optional in Texas and typically offers coverage in amounts like $1,000, $2,500, or $5,000. Unlike PIP, MedPay only covers medical expenses - no lost wages or household services - making it a simpler, more focused coverage option.",
        "uninsured": "Protects you when the at-fault Rider has no insurance or insufficient coverage to pay for your injuries and damages. With 12% of Texas registered Motorcycles unmatched to insurance policies, this optional coverage is crucial. It also pays if you're in a hit-and-run accident. Texas insurers must offer this coverage, but you can reject it in writing.",
        "towing": "Covers the cost of towing your Motorcycle to a repair shop or safe location after an accident, breakdown, or if your car becomes disabled. This is specifically for towing services only, not other roadside assistance like jump-starts or tire changes. Coverage limits typically range from $50-$200 per towing incident, and it's an optional add-on that helps with unexpected towing expenses.",
        "rental": "Covers the cost of a rental car while your Motorcycle is being repaired after a covered claim or if it's stolen. Typically pays a daily amount (like $30-$50 per day) for a specified number of days (usually 30 days maximum). This optional coverage ensures you stay mobile while your car is out of commission, helping you maintain your daily routine during the repair process.",
        "roadside": "Provides emergency services when your Motorcycle breaks down or you're stranded, including jump-starts for dead batteries, flat tire changes, lockout assistance, and emergency fuel delivery. Available 24/7 regardless of where the breakdown occurs, this optional coverage. It's separate from towing coverage and focuses on getting you back on the road quickly for minor issues."
