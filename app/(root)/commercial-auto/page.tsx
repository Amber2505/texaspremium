        What Is Commercial Auto Insurance in Texas?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Commercial auto insurance in Texas is a policy designed to protect
        vehicles used for business purposes, such as delivery vans, company
        cars, or service trucks. Unlike personal auto insurance, it covers
        unique risks associated with business operations, including liability,
        vehicle damage, and employee-related incidents. In Texas, commercial
        auto insurance is often required to meet state regulations and protect
        your business assets.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This insurance ensures your business can operate smoothly, even after
        accidents, theft, or other incidents involving your commercial vehicles.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-gray-700 text-3xl mt-8">
        Why Do You Need Commercial Auto Insurance in Texas?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Businesses that rely on vehicles need commercial auto insurance to
        protect against financial losses and comply with Texas laws. Common
        reasons to get commercial auto insurance include:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 pl-5">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: Texas requires businesses to
          carry minimum liability coverage (30/60/25) for vehicles used
          commercially to cover bodily injury and property damage.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Business Asset Protection</strong>: Protects your investment
          in vehicles, which are critical to your operations, from damage,
          theft, or vandalism.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Employee Safety</strong>: Covers accidents involving employees
          driving company vehicles, including medical expenses or liability
          claims.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Client or Contract Requirements</strong>: Many clients or
          contracts require proof of commercial auto insurance before doing
          business.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Liability Risks</strong>: Protects your business from lawsuits
          if a company vehicle causes injury or property damage to others.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Business Continuity</strong>: Ensures your business can
          recover quickly from vehicle-related incidents without significant
          financial strain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Even if not legally required, commercial auto insurance is essential for
        businesses to mitigate risks and maintain operational stability.
