          <strong>Need an SR-22 in Texas?</strong> This guide explains what an

        What Is SR-22 Insurance in Texas?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In Texas, an SR-22 is a{" "}
        <strong>Certificate of Financial Responsibility</strong> filed by your
        auto insurance company with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)
        to prove you carry the state&#39;s minimum liability insurance coverage.
        It&#39;s not a type of insurance but a document verifying that you meet
        Texas&#39;s financial responsibility requirements, typically required
        for high-risk drivers after serious driving violations or license
        suspensions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The SR-22 ensures you maintain continuous insurance coverage for a
        specified period, allowing you to regain or maintain your driving
        privileges in Texas.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-gray-700 text-3xl mt-8">
        Why Might You Need an SR-22 in Texas?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In Texas, an SR-22 is required for drivers who have committed certain
        violations or had their license suspended. Common reasons include:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-4 pl-5">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>DWI or DUI convictions</strong>: Driving while intoxicated or
          under the influence is a common trigger for an SR-22 requirement.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Driving without insurance</strong>: Operating a vehicle
          without valid liability insurance violates Texas law and often
          requires an SR-22.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Driving with a suspended or revoked license</strong>: If
          caught driving while your license is suspended, you may need an SR-22
          to reinstate it.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Serious traffic violations</strong>: Offenses like reckless
          driving or accumulating too many points on your driving record can
          lead to an SR-22 mandate.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>At-fault accidents without insurance</strong>: Causing an
          accident while uninsured often requires an SR-22 to prove future
          financial responsibility.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Failure to pay judgments</strong>: Unresolved traffic-related
          judgments may necessitate an SR-22 filing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Texas DPS or a court will notify you if an SR-22 is required,
        typically through a court order or a letter from the DPS.
      </p>

        How Does SR-22 Insurance Work in Texas?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        An SR-22 in Texas is a form your insurance provider files with the Texas
        DPS to confirm you have at least the state&#39;s minimum liability
        insurance, which is 30/60/25 coverage ($30,000 per person, $60,000 per
        accident for bodily injury, and $25,000 for property damage). Here&#39;s
        how the process works:
      </p>
      <ol className="mb-4 pl-5">
        <li>
          <strong>Notification</strong>: You receive a court order or a letter
          from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) stating that you’re
          required to file an SR-22.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Us</strong>: Reach out to{" "}
          <strong>Texas Premium Insurance Services</strong>, and we’ll handle
          the SR-22 process for you—making it simple and stress-free.
          <br />- If you <strong>own a vehicle</strong>, we can provide you with
          an auto insurance policy that includes the SR-22 filing.
          <br />- If you <strong>don’t own a car</strong>, we’ll help you obtain
          a <strong>non-owner SR-22 policy</strong> that meets Texas
          requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Filing the SR-22</strong>: Once your policy is in place, we’ll
          have your insurer <strong>electronically file the SR-22</strong> with
          the Texas DPS. Most companies charge a small filing fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Submit to DPS</strong>: In addition to the electronic filing,
          you are also required to submit your SR-22 documentation to the Texas
          DPS. You can send it using any of the following methods:
          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain Coverage</strong>: You must maintain continuous
          insurance coverage for the duration of the SR-22 requirement,
          typically <strong>2 years</strong> in Texas. A lapse in coverage will
          result in penalties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DPS Monitoring</strong>: The Texas DPS actively monitors your
          insurance status. If your policy lapses or is canceled, your insurer
          will file an <strong>SR-26 form</strong>, which can result in{" "}
          <strong>license suspension</strong> or other consequences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Completion</strong>: After the SR-22 period ends, you can
          request to end the filing, and we will coordinate with your insurer to
          stop the SR-22 submission, which may{" "}
          <strong>lower your premiums</strong>.
