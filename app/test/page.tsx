            What is a Texas Bonded Title?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A <strong>Texas Certificate of Title Surety Bond</strong>, commonly
            known as a bonded title, is a document issued by the Texas
            Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV) to establish vehicle ownership
            when the original title is lost, damaged, incorrectly assigned, or
            unavailable. The bond, required under Texas Transportation Code
            §501.053, serves as a financial guarantee to protect previous
            owners, lienholders, and future owners against fraudulent ownership
            claims. It remains active for three years, after which a standard
            title is issued if no claims are filed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            A bonded title allows you to register, insure, sell, or transfer
            ownership of a vehicle legally in Texas. It’s often needed in
            situations like purchasing a vehicle without a title, recovering a
            stolen vehicle, or dealing with incomplete transactions.

            Why Do You Need a Bonded Title?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The Texas DMV requires a bonded title when you cannot provide
            adequate proof of ownership. Common scenarios include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>The original title is lost or stolen.</li>
            <li>The title was never received from the seller.</li>
            <li>The title is damaged or illegible.</li>
            <li>
              The title was improperly assigned (e.g., missing signatures).
            </li>
            <li>
              The vehicle was purchased without a title in a private sale.
            </li>
            <li>The vehicle was gifted without a title transfer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            The surety bond protects the TxDMV and others by ensuring
            compensation if someone else proves rightful ownership during the
            bond’s three-year term.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            To qualify for a Texas bonded title, you must meet the following
            criteria:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              Be a Texas resident or military personnel stationed in Texas.

              Ensure the vehicle is complete (frame, motor, and body; or frame
              and motor for motorcycles).
            </li>
            <li>
              For out-of-state vehicles, obtain a VIN inspection from a
              Texas-certified Safety Inspection Station or an auto theft
              investigator if never titled in Texas.
            </li>

              appraisal from a licensed auto dealer or insurance adjuster. For
